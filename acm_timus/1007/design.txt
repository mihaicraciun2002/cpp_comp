If the size of the string is N + 1, then we know a symbol has been inserted.
We iterate through the string, and simulate removing an element (O(1) with partial sums)
and check if the condition is satisfied

If the size of the string is N:
If the condition is already satisfied, then its fine
Otherwise, sum up the position of 1s and take the remainder of the division to N + 1, that
will be the position of the bad 1.

If the size of the string is N - 1:
At each position, see if inserting a 0 or 1 would satisfy the condition in the problem
