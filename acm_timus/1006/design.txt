We keep extracting full squares
We replace these full squares with a dud character that can be molded in any other character
For every dud character we now have, we first place a upper left corner, then search for
a dud character on the same line to the left to put a upper right corner, then a dud character on
the same column to the bottom to put a lower right corner, and then finally a lower left corner.
Of course, we can use a proper character if we find one instead of a dud one. If we can form
a full square, then continue.
We stop when we run out of original characters. Also we try to maximize the size of the square so
that we fit into N squares, by starting from the farthest "good" character

Precompute all possible squares and always fill the one with the most unused characters,
and in case of equality fill the largest one, sort by how complete the blocks are and
erase the one that is the most complete
Also, before extracting one more square, make sure that we're not extracting a square that cannot be
extracted at this moment. How do we check this? Well, if one of its elements is a star, then its fine.
But if one of its elements is a real character, and it's not in concordance with the square (for example,
we're on the top bar, and the character is | instead of _ or *), then we won't take it into account.
