First, since both percentages are specified to be up to 2 decimal points,
we can write them as:
a/10000 and b/10000, with a, b integers

We now need to find the smallest y, s.t. there is a x
with
a/10000 <= x/y <= b/10000
so

a <= x*10000/y <= b, a,b in N and smaller than 10000

For y = 10000, we just take x in between a and b

so y <= 10000

For each y between 1 and 10000, we see if there is a multiple of 10000
between a * y and b * y
