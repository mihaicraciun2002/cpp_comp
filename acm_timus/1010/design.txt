The gradient always has to strictly increase, otherwise we'll have points over or on the gradient line
Also, if the gradient is currently positive, then it's always optimal to connect with the guy right before.
If the gradient is on a negative trend, then its optimal to connect to the furthest guy to the left (the one
that saw the first negative gradient)
