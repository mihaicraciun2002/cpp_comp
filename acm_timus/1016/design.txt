Attempt #1:
Bellman Ford
d[position][config]
config - the current permutation for the cube
4 * 6 = 24 possible configs (6 possible bottoms with 4 possible rotations)
position - 64 possible configs

near far top right bottom left
1    2   3   4     5      6

If we move to the left:
New:
near far top right bottom left
1    2   4   5     6      3

If we move to the right:
New:
near far top right bottom left
1    2   6   3     4      5

If we move down:
New:
near far top right bottom left
3    5   2   4     1      6

If we move up:
New:
near far top right bottom left
5    3   1   4     2      6

Note: since we're applying rotations without changing the system of reference (we don't change what
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 mean), we need to apply the rotation first, and then the previous rotation.
