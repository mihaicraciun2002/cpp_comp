The unicity of a cube is determined by the pairs of opposing sides, as well as the order of the pairs.
We try to bring 1 and its opposite correspondent to the first two positions.
If they're already there, its fine.
There are two cases (1 is on (top bottom) or (forward backward)), quite straight forward to deduce from the sample on
what equivalent cube would have 1 on one of the first two positions.
Then we write the permutation made from positions 3,4,5,6(since they're in a sequence on a cube), starting from the
smallest number in the permutation, and accounting for the parity of positions 1,2 (if 1 is on the first position,
then the order is ascending, if 1 is on the 2nd position, order is decreasing). This will uniquely determine
a cube.
