BigInt class that should be somewhat efficient
The base is 10^9 instead of 10
Perhaps a better implementation would use 2^31 or 2^63 to use the overflow feature
Addition and subtraction work
Multiplication - two ways of doing it, either Karatsuba or fft, only Karatsuba works as of now
Division - still not 100% sure how I'll do it, probably use some trick to reuse multiplication

Update 1 oct 2023:
Base is now 10^4 since fft would bring the total over the limit of long long
FFT seems to work, but larger tests are needed
Performance is also probably reduced quite a lot since the base has been lowered drastically
On large numbers, performance is around 2x as slow now
