BigInt class that should be somewhat efficient
The base is 10^9 instead of 10
Perhaps a better implementation would use 2^31 or 2^63 to use the overflow feature
Addition and subtraction work
Multiplication - two ways of doing it, either Karatsuba or fft, only Karatsuba works as of now
Division - still not 100% sure how I'll do it, probably use some trick to reuse multiplication
